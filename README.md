assets/feature_graphic.png: A nice graphic or another screenshot showing the map/route (approx 600x400px).

assets/favicon.png: Your app icon (32x32px).

assets/og-image.jpg: An image for social media sharing (1200x630px).

YOUR_PLAY_STORE_LINK_HERE: Paste your Google Play Store URL.

mailto:support@freerider.com: Update with your actual support email.
